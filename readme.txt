// NUCAMP SITE //

This is a test site that I am sequentially developing to complete course requirements and exercises for Nucamp's Fullstack Web + Mobile Development course. The intent is to practically apply acquired skillsets by building an intuitive and responsive website that incorporates a wide variety of design and functional elements.

Additional Details:

• The first (5) weeks of the course focus specifically on deploying a combination Bootstrap components and JavaScript to achieve this.

• The fictional company - NuCamp - manages a verified partner database of campsites/campgrounds that meet a certain quality standard.
